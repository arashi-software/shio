    "keys": ["hello"] // Valid keys, can be left blank if use_key is false. list of strings
}
```

## Usage

shio

**Shio will be run on port 5000**

Files can be uploaded through curl or any other program that can create http requests.

- You must provide the key that you have configured (if use_key is true in your config) as the key header
```sh
# curl
curl -X POST -F 'file=@<File-path-here>' -H 'key: <Your-configured-key-here>' <shio-url>
```
